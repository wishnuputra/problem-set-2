Problem Set 2
==============

These repository are my program for the problem set 2
of MIT 6.00.1x course.

Problem set 2 is about calculating fixed monthly payment
of a credit card.

Each month, a credit card statement will come with the
option for you to pay a minimum amount of your charge,
usually 2% of the balance due. However, the credit card
company earns money by charging interest on the balance
that you don't pay. So even if you pay credit card
payments on time, interest is still accruing on the
outstanding balance.

For example:
Say you've made a $5,000 purchase on a credit card with
an 18% annual interest rate and a 2% minimum monthly
payment rate. If you only pay the minimum monthly amount
for a year, how much is the remaining balance?
